#### Discussion papers for week 10

You need to read the paper plus submit a small written reflection. The reflection should be **pushed to github before class**.  You won't get credit for the discussion unless you push to github before class. The reflection should include your thoughts on each of the questions under "questions to consider" below. It can be very brief and in bullet-point form but feel free to expand if you prefer.



**Tuesday**

* By zoom (link on landing page)
* Transfer learning
* Share experience with xgboost
* Individual meetings



**Thursday**

* Borowiec ML, Dikow RB, Frandsen PB, McKeeken A, Valentini G, White AE (2022). Deep learning as a tool for ecology and evolution. *Methods in Ecology and Evolution* 13: 1640-1660. https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13901.
* This is a review of deep learning applications to provide an overview
* Questions to consider:
  * What applications of deep learning strike you as likely to make the greatest impact in ecology/evolution and why?
  * What applications are particularly important for your own research and how could you apply them? 
  * (Optional) Do you know of any applications not covered by this review?
  * 2-3 other bullet points, which might be insights or questions you want to raise in the discussion

Extra reading (optional)

* The following paper is an excellent review that summarizes our course and re-emphasizes what the first 8 weeks have been about, while broadening the scope to cover a few odds and ends we didn't have time for. It has a shorter but useful review of applications.

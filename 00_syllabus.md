#### Where is it pitched?
This is a practical class. Our aim is to understand the concepts, theory, and algorithms behind the main categories of machine learning algorithms and in particular be able to place any machine learning tool, that typically consists of a collection of algorithms, within a wider data-science context and to identify strengths and weaknesses in its application and when and where it can appropriately be used. A further goal is to be able to combine fundamental algorithms to make your own tools for specific applications. I will try to develop an intuitive understanding of the foundational algorithms and concepts mostly through coding with example datasets plus a bit of basic math. You will code and apply these algorithms to your own datasets. From this foundation you should be able to go deeper through self study.

#### Prerequisites
I will largely demonstrate using R but will provide equivalent Python code. This is not a beginners class in either R, Python or data science! Ideally you will have taken Part 1 of my EBIO5460 sequence (Part 1: Data Science for Biological Research). If you haven't taken that class it is possible to take the present class but a little catch up will be necessary. I strongly suggest you at least have taken some sort of statistics or computation class, for example, either my grad class "QEE: Quantitative Ecology and Evolution" or "Biological Statistics", or Sam Flaxman's "Computational Biology", or an equivalent intermediate-level data science class. You must already be proficient with R or Python, preferably with experience with your own data. Alternatively, if you are proficient in another language, then you should be fine (I will largely use fundamental coding techniques that are similar in most languages). Proficiency with GitHub is presumed but I will provide materials to quickly get up to speed if you are not already (don't worry, you will initially only need some basic skills). Please see me to discuss any prerequisite areas you think you might need guidance about.

#### The ultimate learning goals
* You will have an understanding of the fundamental concepts and algorithms that underpin most of machine learning
* You will be confident to use machine learning algorithms in your own research
* You will have a broad overview of how ecologists are currently using machine learning algorithms to revolutionize ecological research

#### Learning format
I'm envisioning a collaborative learning atmosphere. Machine learning is a rapidly advancing field and many new techniques have not yet been applied or are only starting to be applied in ecology. We'll explore these cutting-edge areas. For the first half, I'll mostly lecture on fundamental concepts and you'll have weekly reading and practical coding assignments. Collaboration is encouraged both in and out of class. Next, in a student-driven discussion and presentation format, we'll explore the recent literature in ecology to consider where machine learning is having a revolutionizing impact on research. In an individual project you'll apply algorithms to your own data, which ideally will help you address your thesis research. Alternatively you can choose to do a literature review.

I hope that we can create an environment that is relaxed and nonjudgmental so that we'll all feel comfortable participating and also that all contributions are valued. I also hope that we can create an environment of respect for each other's learning processes and ideas.

#### Computing
You'll need access to computing. If you have a reasonably modern laptop, that's perfect. If you don't have access to computing please let me know as soon as possible. I can provide access to some great alternative compute resources. We'll also learn about and use the University of Colorado supercomputing resources.

#### Coding environment
Please upgrade to the latest version of R or Python. I will use R Studio, VSCode, and/or Positron as my integrated development environment (IDE). You are welcome to use whatever IDE you prefer. I'm assuming you use these tools regularly and are proficient at upgrading already.

#### Texts
We'll sample from several texts and papers. Most of it is available free to you. If there is any material that can't be posted publicly, I'll post it to the class Google Drive folder.

The main text book that the first eight weeks of the semester will be based around is:

* James G, Witten D, Hastie T, Tibshirani R (2021). An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R (or Python), Second edition. Springer, New York.
* [Book website](https://www.statlearning.com/): free download

Other more advanced texts that I personally am referencing extensively include:

* Goodfellow I, Bengio Y, Courville A (2016). Deep Learning. The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
* Hastie T, Tibshirani R, Friedman JH (2009). The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, 2nd ed. Springer, New York, NY.

A text heavily influencing the way I think about the broader topic of data science from an interdisciplinary perspective is:

* Efron B & Hastie T (2016). Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science. Cambridge.
* This text is aimed at masters or first-year PhD students in statistics and data science. After completing this course (and the complementary semester in Part 1), you might find this a useful book with a friendly level of math.

Paperback versions of just about any Springer text can be purchased by University of Colorado students for $25 each. To purchase, do a Chinook search via the CU library (you must be on the campus network or via VPN, not the guest wifi), follow the link to the ebook version, and look for the Springer offer to buy the paperback version. Be aware however that these versions are not in color, which is certainly an issue for interpreting plots!

#### GitHub
Almost everything will be on Github rather than Canvas. I have set up a GitHub organization that is restricted to our class (i.e. your individual repositories are not public). Bookmark this URL:
* https://github.com/EBIO5460Spring2025

All of your work will be tracked and submitted here (via a Git commit and push).

#### Your fieldwork
I realize that as graduate students you may have fieldwork or other research to complete during the semester. Please see me early on so we can talk about how we can work around your fieldwork.

#### My commitments
I possibly will need to travel for short periods for talks or fieldwork. If that happens I will endeavor to give the class via Zoom at the usual time. If I'm sometimes unable to attend the scheduled class time I will provide materials for these classes and you should show up and participate as usual.

#### Classroom behavior

Students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote, or online. Failure to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, marital status, political affiliation, or political philosophy. For more information, see the [classroom behavior policy](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior), the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/media/230), and the [Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/).

#### Accommodation for disabilities, temporary medical conditions, and medical isolation

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed.  Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the [Disability Services website](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/). Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or DSinfo@colorado.edu for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition, see [Temporary Medical Conditions](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions) on the Disability Services website.

If you have a temporary illness, injury or required medical isolation for which you require adjustment, email me and we'll work something out.

#### Preferred student names and pronouns

CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun.

#### Honor code

All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the [Honor Code](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/media/229). Violations of the Honor Code may include but are not limited to: plagiarism (including use of paper writing services or technology [such as essay bots]), cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. Understanding the course's syllabus is a vital part in adhering to the Honor Code.

All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution: StudentConduct@colorado.edu. Students found responsible for violating the Honor Code will be assigned resolution outcomes from the Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution as well as be subject to academic sanctions from the faculty member. Visit [Honor Code](https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/media/229) for more information on the academic integrity policy.


#### Sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation

CU Boulder is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. University policy prohibits [protected-class](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/policies/discrimination-harassment-policy/protected-class-definitions) discrimination and harassment, sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner abuse (dating or domestic violence), stalking, and related retaliation by or against members of our community on- and off-campus. The Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) addresses these concerns, and individuals who have been subjected to misconduct can contact OIEC at 303-492-2127 or email [CUreport@colorado.edu](mailto:CUreport@colorado.edu). Information about university policies, [reporting options](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/reporting-resolutions/making-report), and [support resources](https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/support-resources) including confidential services can be found on the [OIEC website](http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/).

Please know that faculty and graduate instructors must inform OIEC when they are made aware of incidents related to these policies regardless of when or where something occurred. This is to ensure that individuals impacted receive outreach from OIEC about resolution options and support resources. To learn more about reporting and support for a variety of concerns, visit the[ ](https://www.colorado.edu/dontignoreit/)[Don’t Ignore It](https://www.colorado.edu/dontignoreit/) page.


#### Religious accommodations

Campus policy requires faculty to provide reasonable accommodations for students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. Please communicate the need for a religious accommodation in a timely manner. In this class, in most cases you should have sufficient time to complete the assignments and submit them on time, or early if appropriate. If this does not work for your situation, please notify me at least two weeks in advance of the conflict to request special accommodation. See the [campus policy regarding religious observances](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams) for full details.

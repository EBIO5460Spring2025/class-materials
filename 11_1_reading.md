#### Discussion papers for week 11

You need to read the paper plus submit a small written reflection. The reflection should be **pushed to github before class**.  You won't get credit for the discussion unless you push to github before class. The reflection should include your thoughts on each of the questions under "questions to consider" below. It can be very brief and in bullet-point form but feel free to expand if you prefer.



**Tuesday**

We will share notes about models and data. 

Preparation: spend a couple of hours researching models and datasets relevant to your individual project. Try to find at least 1-2 models and 1 dataset. Starter resources for places to look include:

* The two review papers from last week
* https://paperswithcode.com/sota
* [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5444970/machine_learning_ecology_2025/library) (curated selection of papers for our class)
  * Feel free to add your own best finds papers to the "new" folder!

For each model and dataset you find add a brief description to this slide deck

**Thursday**

* Valavi R, Guillera-Arroita G, Lahoz-Monfort JJ, Elith J (2021). Predictive performance of presence-only species distribution models: a benchmark study with reproducible code. *Ecological Monographs* 0:e01486. https://doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1486.
* This is a case study using a range of machine learning algorithms, including random forest and boosting (but not deep learning)
* Questions to consider:
  * What general principles of machine learning algorithms are demonstrated among the models considered?
  * What modeling approaches were found to be best?
  * What is it about those algorithms that likely made them the best performers?
  * Can the performance of any of the algorithms be improved (and likely by how much)?
  * Why does downsampled random forest perform better than regular random forest? Would this affect other algorithms considered in the paper?
  * What could be the impact of the sizes of the datasets on the conclusions from this paper?
  * Do you have any critiques of the paper, either methodological or about the conclusions drawn?
  * 2-3 other bullet points, which might be insights or questions you want to raise in the discussion
